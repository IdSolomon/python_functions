# Functions At Last!

Python functions has finally arrived!

In programming, as the code becomes bigger and more complex, the same set of steps 
will begin to be repeated.

I could write the same code over and over again, but that'll only drive me insane! So, 
there's a better way - FUNCTIONS!!

With functions I can group code into reusable blocks. Functions contain a sequence of steps 
that can be performed repeatedly throughout a program without having to repeat the process 
of writing the same code again.

So witness the files that represent Python functions --

- Defining a Function
- Calling a Function
- Whitespace and Execution Flow
- Parameters and Arguments
- Multiple Parameters
- Types of Arguments
- Built-in Functions vs User Defined Functions
- Variable Access
- Returns
- Multiple Returns

Excellent!
